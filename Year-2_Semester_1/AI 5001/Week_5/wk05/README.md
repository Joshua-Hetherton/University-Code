# COMP5001 Week 5 - Automated Planning

## 

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Before running any code, you need to prepare your Python environment:

**Create a new virtual environment** (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate    # On Windows
# .venv/bin/activate      # On Mac/Linux
```

**Install required packages**:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Try the Jupyter Notebook file

```bash
jupyter notebook planning.ipynb
```

### Step 3: Further explore the code** (for programmers)

Look at `planning.py` to see how the algorithms are implemented.

## About This Code

This educational project is based on the excellent AIMA (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach) Python codebase, modified for COMP5001 at the University of Winchester. The original code is available at [github.com/aimacode/aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) under the MIT License.

**Why use existing code?** Learning AI is challenging enough without implementing everything from scratch. By building on well-tested foundations, you can focus on understanding concepts rather than debugging basic implementations.
