    "## Propositional Knowledge Bases: `PropKB`\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Knowledge Base (KB)** is like a database that stores logical facts and rules. The `PropKB` class represents a knowledge base containing propositional logic sentences (statements that are either true or false).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Design Pattern\n",
    "The base `KB` class has four main methods besides `__init__`. Here's an important design detail: the `ask` method simply calls the `ask_generator` method. This means when you create your own KB class, you only need to implement `ask_generator` - the `ask` method is already handled for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods of `PropKB`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏗️ Constructor: `__init__(self, sentence=None)`**\n",
    "- Creates a `clauses` field - a list storing all sentences in the knowledge base\n",
    "- Each sentence is stored as a 'clause' (a sentence made up of only literals connected by `or` operations)\n",
    "- Think of clauses as the \"building blocks\" of logical knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**📝 Adding Knowledge: `tell(self, sentence)`** \n",
    "- Use this to add new facts or rules to your knowledge base\n",
    "- **Magic feature**: You can add ANY logical sentence - the method automatically converts it to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) and extracts clauses\n",
    "- No need to manually convert to clauses - just tell the KB what you know!\n",
    "\n",
    "**❓ Querying Knowledge: `ask_generator(self, query)`**\n",
    "- This is the \"brain\" of the KB - it determines if the KB entails (logically implies) your query\n",
    "- Uses the `tt_entails` function (truth table method) to check entailment\n",
    "- **Return values explained**:\n",
    "  - Returns `{}` (empty dict) if the query is entailed by the KB\n",
    "  - Returns `None` if the query is not entailed\n",
    "  - *Why not just True/False?* This design maintains consistency with First-Order Logic, where we need to return variable substitutions\n",
    "- **Practical tip**: Use `ask_if_true()` if you prefer simple True/False answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**🗑️ Removing Knowledge: `retract(self, sentence)`**\n",
    "- Removes facts from the knowledge base\n",
    "- Like `tell()`, it handles any sentence format - automatically converts to clauses before removal"

    "To prove that KB entails α, we assume α is false and try to derive a contradiction. If we succeed, then α must be true!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation**:\n",
    "- We want to check if $\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ (KB entails α)\n",
    "- **Key insight**: This is equivalent to checking if $\\text{KB} \\land \\neg \\alpha$ is unsatisfiable\n",
    "- If KB and ¬α cannot both be true, then whenever KB is true, α must also be true\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Resolution Algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Add ¬α to the KB (assume the opposite of what we want to prove)\n",
    "2. **Apply Resolution Rule**: Repeatedly combine clauses that have complementary literals\n",
    "   - Example: From $(A \\lor B)$ and $(\\neg A \\lor C)$, derive $(B \\lor C)$\n",
    "   - This eliminates the contradictory pair $(A, \\neg A)$\n",
    "3. **Termination Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **Success**: If we derive the **empty clause** (□), we have a contradiction! → KB entails α\n",
    "   - **Failure**: If no new clauses can be derived → KB does not entail α\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the Empty Clause Means Contradiction**:\n",
    "The empty clause (□) represents \"False\" and can only arise from resolving complementary unit clauses like $P$ and $\\neg P$. Since nothing can be both true and false simultaneously, this proves our assumption (¬α) leads to contradiction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Types of Horn Clauses**:\n",
    "1. **Facts**: Single positive literals (e.g., `A`)\n",
    "2. **Rules**: Implications with positive conclusion (e.g., `A ∧ B ⇒ C`)\n",
    "3. **Constraints**: All negative literals (e.g., `¬A ∨ ¬B ∨ ¬C`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Horn Clause Transformation**:\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Horn Clauses Are Special**:\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Human-Like Reasoning**: Horn clauses naturally represent how we think:\n",

    "- Entailment checking is **linear** in the size of the knowledge base\n",
    "- Each clause is processed at most once (unlike exponential methods)\n",

    "🏗️ **Clear Structure**:\n",
    "- **Body (premise)**: Conjunction of positive literals (the \"if\" part)\n",
    "- **Head (conclusion)**: Single positive literal (the \"then\" part)\n",
    "- **Facts**: Just the head with no body\n",

    "\n",

    "#### 🎯 **Optimization 2: Pure Symbol Heuristic**  \n",
    "**The Idea**: If a variable appears with only one polarity (all positive or all negative), assign it to make all its clauses true.\n",

    "**Example Process**:\n",
    "1. Start with: $(P \\lor Q), (\\neg P \\lor R), (\\neg Q)$\n",
    "2. Third clause forces: $Q = \\text{false}$ \n",

    "\n",
    "**Local Search with Random Escapes** 🎲\n",
    "\n",
    "WalkSAT takes a completely different approach from DPLL - instead of systematic search, it uses **local search** similar to hill climbing optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Strategy**:\n",
    "1. **Start with a random assignment** of truth values\n",
    "2. **Iteratively improve** by flipping variable values\n",
    "3. **Balance greed with randomness** to avoid getting stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 **The WalkSAT Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Pick an Unsatisfied Clause**\n",
    "- Look at all clauses that are currently false\n",
    "- Randomly select one to focus on\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Choose a Variable to Flip**  \n",
    "This is where the algorithm gets clever - it has two strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🧠 Greedy Move** (probability 1-p): Pick the variable flip that minimizes the number of newly broken clauses\n",
    "- **🎲 Random Move** (probability p): Pick any variable in the clause randomly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Flip and Repeat**\n",
    "- Change the chosen variable's truth value\n",
    "- Repeat until satisfied or max iterations reached\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚖️ **The Randomness Trade-off**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Mix Greedy + Random?**\n",
    "- **Pure Greedy**: Fast improvement but gets stuck in local optima (like hill climbing)\n",
    "- **Pure Random**: Avoids getting stuck but makes no progress\n",
    "- **Mixed Strategy**: Best of both worlds!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter Tuning**:\n",
    "- **High p (more random)**: Better at escaping local minima, slower convergence  \n",
    "- **Low p (more greedy)**: Faster initial progress, higher chance of getting stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏃‍♂️ **Advantages of WalkSAT**\n",
    "- **Speed**: Often much faster than complete algorithms like DPLL for satisfiable instances\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handles very large problems that would overwhelm systematic methods  \n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ **Limitations**\n",
    "- **Incomplete**: Cannot prove unsatisfiability (might search forever)\n",
    "- **No Guarantees**: May fail to find solutions even when they exist\n",
    "- **Parameter Sensitive**: Performance depends on the randomness parameter p\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: WalkSAT excels when you need to quickly find solutions to large, satisfiable problems and don't need to prove unsatisfiability."

    "Imagine you have two puzzle pieces with slightly different patterns, but you suspect they might match if you fill in some blanks correctly. Unification is the algorithm that figures out how to fill those blanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Unification?**\n",
    "Unification finds **substitutions** (variable replacements) that make two logical expressions identical.\n",

    "**Input**: Two logical expressions that might have variables\n",
    "**Output**: A **unifier** - a dictionary of variable substitutions, or `None` if no match is possible\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "1. **Compare structures**: Check if the expressions have the same logical structure\n",
    "2. **Match constants**: Constants must match exactly  \n",
    "3. **Bind variables**: Variables can be replaced with constants or other terms\n",
    "4. **Recursive matching**: Apply the same process to sub-expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle**: A variable can unify with any term (constant, variable, or complex expression), but constants can only unify with identical constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Unification Matters**:\n",
    "- **Essential for FOL inference**: Both forward and backward chaining rely heavily on unification\n",
