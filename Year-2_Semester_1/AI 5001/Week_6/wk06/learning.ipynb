At each non-leaf node of the tree an attribute of the input is tested, based on which corresponding branch leading to a child-node is selected. At the leaf node the input is classified based on the class label of this leaf node.

The data is expected to be a tuple in which each record of the tuple is an attribute used for classification.

    "## 11. SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS\n",
    "\n",
    "You've explored the fundamental concepts of machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms Covered\n",
    "1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Simple, intuitive, works well with small datasets\n",
    "2. Decision Trees: Easy to interpret, automatically finds important features\n",
    "3. Linear Learner: Fast, works well for linearly separable data\n",
    "4. Logistic Linear Learner: Like linear learner but outputs probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "- No single algorithm is always best - performance depends on the dataset\n",
    "- Evaluation is crucial - always test on unseen data\n",
    "- Parameters matter - choosing the right k, distance function, etc. affects performance\n",
    "- Cross-validation gives more reliable estimates than a single train-test split\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Which Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm | Best For | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|------|------|\n",
    "| k-NN | Small datasets, complex boundaries | Simple, no training needed | Slow for large data, sensitive to irrelevant features |\n",
    "| Decision Tree | Interpretable models, mixed data types | Easy to understand, handles categorical data | Can overfit, unstable |\n",
    "| Linear Learner | Large datasets, simple relationships | Fast, stable | Only works for linear relationships |\n",
    "| Logistic Learner | Binary classification, probability outputs | Outputs probabilities, regularizable | Limited to linear boundaries |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Try these algorithms on your own datasets\n",
    "- Learn about more advanced techniques (neural networks, ensemble methods)\n",
    "- Explore feature engineering and data preprocessing\n",
    "- Study more evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)\n",
    "\n",
